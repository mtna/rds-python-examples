# RDS COVID-19 IPython Notebook
## WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE. CONTENT OR CODE SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TESTING OR EVALUATION PURPOSES.
This notebook demonstrates the power and efficiency of our Rich Data Services (RDS) framework through the use of a simple python API library. As the COVID-19 pandemic is of a global concern, this notebook focuses on the COVID-19 data gathered through [John Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

## Software
Python version 3.5 or higher is required for the notebook.

The [Rich Data Services Python](https://github.com/mtna/rds-python) project is used to query for data from our databases as well as to get any relevant metadata. This can be installed by running
```bash
pip install mtna-rds
```
