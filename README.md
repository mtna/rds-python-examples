This notebook demonstrates the power and efficiency of our Rich Data Services (RDS) framework through the use of a simple python API library. As the COVID-19 pandemic is of a global concern, this notebook focuses on the COVID-19 data gathered through [John Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

## Software
Python version 3.5 or higher is required for the notebook.

The [Rich Data Services Python](https://github.com/mtna/rds-python) project is used to query for data from our databases as well as to get any relevant metadata.

## About
This notebook is published and maintained by [MTNA](https://www.mtna.us/).
